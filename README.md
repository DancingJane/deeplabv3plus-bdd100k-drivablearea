# Deeplabv3+ BDD100k/drivable_area implementation

### Introduction

This repository is from https://github.com/jfzhang95/pytorch-deeplab-xception.
For BDD100k/drivable_area semantic segmentation, I added 
1. bdd100k drivable area dataloader.
2. prediction visualization for both color(visual result), and id(greyscale png file for submission).
3. sliding window prediction. (not recommended)
